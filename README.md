# Artista

A flutter project about an artist-oriented instagram.

## File structure

The structure is not well managed at the moment, but we have (in the lib folder) :

- A 'Models' folder, with every model used in the app : Discussion, Message, Post, TextDiscuss
- A 'Components' folder, with every component of the app
- Every other file, directly at the root
